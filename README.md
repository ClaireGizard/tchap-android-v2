# Tchap Android

Tchap Android v2 is an Android Matrix client.

# New Android SDK

Tchap is based on a new Android SDK fully written in Kotlin (like Element). In order to make the early development as fast as possible, Tchap and the new SDK currently share the same git repository.

At each Tchap release, the SDK module is copied to a dedicated repository: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2. That way, third party apps can add a regular gradle dependency to use it. So more details on how to do that here: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2.
